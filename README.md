# BlackBasta-Chats-IPs-URLs
All the IP Addresses and URLs referenced in the leaked BlackBasta chats from September 18th, 2023 to September 28th, 2024

The original leak has 196,045 messages. Apart from general banter and shared credentials, the chat leak references over 4000 IP addresses and about 9000 unique URLs in various capacity - from listed IPs and URLs with credentials to public links, pings and failed connections. 

We extracted this list so security teams can quickly check whether their own public IP address and URL is even mentioned so they can dig deeper.

**IMPORTANT**
- **Be aware that the IP addresses were mentioned in a period between September 18th, 2023 and September 28th, 2024. When checking the list, make sure your server had the IP address in the same time period**
- **Be aware that the listed URLs were mentioned in varying context. About half were paired with credentials, which we have scrubbed, but some were just links in various chats. We can't evaluate the risk to each URL, but if you find your own URL, make sure to check it's status for indicators of compromise and review any user credentials on it - ideally by fetching the full file and reviewing it in detail.**
